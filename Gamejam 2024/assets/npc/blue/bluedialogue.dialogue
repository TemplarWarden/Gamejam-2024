Blue: [#side=right]I was at work on the day of the murder, I was in a meeting with Orange for most of the day discussing changes to his Annuity.
Blue: Mainly changing it to a lifetime duration. 
Blue: This was done at Mr Grey's request. We talked until about 7:30 pm. 
Blue: After the meeting Orange left and I had more meetings to attend to, I only came back once I had heard what happened.

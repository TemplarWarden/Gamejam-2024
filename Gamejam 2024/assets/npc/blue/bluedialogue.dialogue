Player: [[What's your alibi| What's your story]]
Blue: I was at work on the day of the murder, I was in a meeting with Orange for most of the day discussing changes to his Annuity, Mainly changing it to a lifetime duration. This was done at Mr Grey's request. We talked until about 7:30 pm, and the murder was at 9:00 pm. After the meeting Orange left and I had more meetings to attend to, I only came back once I had heard what happened.
